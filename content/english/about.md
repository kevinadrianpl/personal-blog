## Who am I?

I'm from South Africa and I make things on the internet and occasionally off of it. I'm an experienced System Administrator and cybersecurity professional/researcher. I have a passion for all things security, learning more each day. 

I sometimes play video games, work on different technical projects to enhance my skills in my spare time and I often travel every chance I get. 

I believe that deeply understanding the underlying systems you use (browsers, operating systems, the kernel, network layers, databases, HTTP, or whatever else that you may be running on top of in your business or personal life) is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and to be able to solve real world problems.


## Why do I blog?

I mostly have this blog for selfish reasons. I needed a way to keep track of development over time – whatever I am thinking about or working on such as different technical projects. Another reason is to sharpen my skills on documentation since IT revolves around it. 
I've learnt that writing can improve one's thought process through research and documentation helps reinforce one's knowledge over time. 
Documentation is an important skill. 

So I chose to start this blog as an intellectual journal of sorts, to become more disciplined and grow to be a better security and IT proffessional. 

I research things I find interesting, then document my research with a public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later when needed. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. 

Other than that, this is my personal portfolio and will be using it to 'store' a few of my accomplishments and to randomly post about my passion for the cybersecurity world.
