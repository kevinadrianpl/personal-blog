I'm Kevin, I make things on the internet and occasionally off of it. I'm an experienced System Administrator and aspiring cybersecurity proffessional/researcher. I sometimes play video games, and work on different tech projects to enchance my skills. I believe that deeply understanding the underlying ststems you use (browsers, operating systems, the kernal, network layers, databses, HTTP, or whatever else that you may be running on top of in your business or personal life) is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and to be able to solve hard problems. 

As much as I try to help everyone that requests it, please don't expect technical support from me, I will go out of my way to help when possible.  Please use the comment sections of posts to ask for help, or send me an email to find the help you need.

# Why do you blog?

I mostly use this blog for selfish reasons. I needed a way to keep track of development over time – whatever I am thinking about or working on such as different projects. I research things I find interesting, then document my research with a public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later when needed. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. I firmly believe that blogs are a two way conversation, so I welcome email and comments – as long as they're on topic and civil, more or less.

# Talking to me
