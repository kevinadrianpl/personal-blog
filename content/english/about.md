# whoami

I'm Kevin, I make things on the internet and occasionally off of it. I'm an experienced System Administrator and aspiring cybersecurity professional/researcher. I sometimes play video games, and work on different tech projects to enhance my skills. I believe that deeply understanding the underlying systems you use (browsers, operating systems, the kernel, network layers, databases, HTTP, or whatever else that you may be running on top of in your business or personal life) is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and to be able to solve hard problems. 

# Why do I blog?

I mostly use this blog for selfish reasons. I needed a way to keep track of development over time – whatever I am thinking about or working on such as different projects. I research things I find interesting, then document my research with a public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later when needed. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. I firmly believe that blogs are a two way conversation, so I welcome emails and comments – as long as they're on topic and civil, more or less.
