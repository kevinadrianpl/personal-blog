You should always be wary of downloading attachments or clicking on links from emails, it may contain malware.

In the professional world and our personal lives, we receive emails every day and we are expected to check most of them. Occasionally, spam emails will find their way out of the filters and into our inboxes and some have attachments.

If you look into your spam folder you will see a lot of emails that try to get you to either download an attachment or visit a link. Email attachments are one of the main ways that attackers try to trick people into downloading malware onto their machine and some of them can be very convincing. Good hackers know how to create emails that compel users into downloading the attachment.

If you’re ever unsure that an attachment is legitimate or not, it’s good to know a few easy tests you can do to figure it out, that way you don’t waste much time and you don’t end up downloading something harmful to your computer.

## Always check the file extension first

This is the quickest way to find a potential virus. Most file attachments should be either a pdf, word document (docx), txt or an excel file if it’s something you are supposed to read. If it’s an audio file or a picture you should expect file extensions such as GIF, JPG or JPEG, TIF or TIFF, MPG or MPEG, MP3 and WAV, these are typically safe.

Usually.

Anything outside of these file types should raise an immediate red flag, especially anything that ends in .exe. .exe extensions indicates that it’s an executable file, which means it will run code on your machine. Most viruses are pieces of code that run on your computer and do something that you don’t want them to do so it’s very risky to download a .exe file from an attachment of an email, or in general if you don't know how reputable the source of the file is.

You should also be suspicious if you see any file with a double extension, such as image.gif.exe, people typically only do this if they want to avoid detection and this almost never happens outside of someone trying to pass off a virus as a legitimate file.

## Always check the email domain

Another way that attackers will try to deceive users is by claiming to be from a certain company by using a domain or a signature in the email. For example, if it says they are emailing on behalf of First National Bank, they should have an email address that ends with “@fnb.co.za”. The email domain should match the company that they are claiming to represent, and not something random @gmail.com for example.

Make sure you check that the domain is spelt correctly as well. Sometimes, attackers will purposely misspell a company's name in hopes that victims won't notice and fall for it.

## Use VirusTotal.com when you feel something is suspicious

VirusTotal is a great free tool that lets you upload files or links and it will run a scan based on more than 30 antivirus providers. It will then return the results to you and let you know if any of the antivirus providers found that file or link to be malicious/dangerous.

It’s easy to use, takes less than 10 seconds to scan and it’s 100% free to use.

If you ever have any doubts about a link that is sent to you, just visit VirusTotal and paste the link without opening it to scan it.

## Research the company trying to contact you

If a company you have never heard of it tries to contact you via email or text, it may be useful to do a quick google search to see if this company is real, if the product they are claiming is legitimate and to get their official contact information.

If you want to make sure that the email you got is legitimate you can contact the company directly through their main webpage and ask them to confirm that the person contacting you is an employee/representative.

This may seem excessive but it is the cost of being safe with your digital life.

You may also want to check sites like Quora or Reddit to see if there is a pattern of attackers running scams using that company's name, often if this is a recurring scam people will discuss it on platforms like these. A quick Google search will verify most worries you may have about any suspicious company contacting you.

## Research the email sender

In addition to researching the company, you can also research the person that sent you the email. A LinkedIn search can help verify if this person works within the industry by looking at their job history or their contacts within the company that they claim to be working for.

You can also look for other people in your contact list that might work at the company. Ideally, you would want to be able to find that person’s name on the company website or they should have a corporate phone extension that you can call to verify that they work with that company.

## Save it to cloud storage and not your local storage

If you receive suspicious emails with attachments on your personal email account, consider saving it to your Google Drive, One Drive, or other cloud storage instead of your local storage. This way if it is a virus, it will be stored in the cloud on your provider’s server rather than locally. Most of these big cloud providers scan files regularly, have hardened servers, DMZs and a lot of other security features that the average person doesn’t so they are much more prepared in case it is malware.

## Do not enable macros unless absolutely necessary

If you download any Microsoft file attachments like Word or Excel, don’t enable macros if you don’t need to or don't trust the source of the document. One method that people use for delivering the virus is to create it using VBA (the programming language used to create Microsoft macros), they attach it to the Microsoft file and when you open the file and enable macros it will cause the virus to run.

If you don’t need to run macros to read the files or do your work then don’t enable them, it’s just an extra risk.

Unless you know where the document is coming from and why it has a macro in it, never enable those macros.
