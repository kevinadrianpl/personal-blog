Thumbnails can be enabled easily by setting the `thumbnail` parameter in the frontmatter to an image such as `"images/projects/code.jpg"`.

Make sure to copy the image the `static/images/` directory.

If put together, it will look like this (that's in fact this post's frontmatter):

```md

tags = [
    "thumbnail",

thumbnail= "images/projects/code.jpg"
