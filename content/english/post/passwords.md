# The importance of secure passwords

Password security is an important subject to consider and provides the first line of defence against unauthorized access to your computer and personal information. 
A strong password will ensure that your device is more protected against bad actors and malicious applications. You should always maintain strong passwords for all your devices and accounts. 

Consider using a password manager because that is one of the best defences against breaches. 
You should always try to avoid reusing passwords which can be one of the easiest methods hackers have of gaining access to your other accounts, by obtaining one of your passwords using brute force attacks, they may use that password on other accounts. 
It is getting easier to use this method now with the cost of high spec computing dropping every year. 


## Here are a few guidelines for creating strong passwords to keep your information secure

-	Use a unique password for each of your important accounts (i.e., email and online banking). Do not use the same password across multiple accounts. 
-	Your password should be at least 12 characters long. Password should consist of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. A long password will offer more           protection than a short password if it is properly constructed.
-	Do not use personal information such as your name, age, date of birth, family members, pets, or any personal details such as favourite songs when constructing your password.
-	Avoid consecutive keyboard combinations (i.e., qwerty or asdfg).
-	Make sure no one is watching while you enter your password. If somebody is, politely ask them to look away or move away. Shoulder surfing is a common method of social           engineering. 
-	Always log off/sign out if you leave your device for the day, especially if it’s not in your personal home – it just takes a few seconds to do, and it’ll help ensure that no     one uses your system for malicious purposes. 
-	Avoid entering your password on computers you don't control – they may have malicious applications installed to purposely steal your password or have keyloggers installed on     them.
-	Avoid entering passwords when connected to unsecured Wi-Fi connections (like at an airport or coffee shop) – hackers can intercept and capture your passwords and data over       unsecured connections. Avoid connecting to public networks in general. 
-	Never tell your password to anyone. Even your IT department or family members.
-	Change your passwords regularly and avoid using the same password repeatedly.
-	Never write down your passwords on paper and hide underneath or near your workstation or telephone. This is usually the first-place bad actors look.
-	Always select “never” when your browser asks for your permission to remember your passwords. You risk losing all your passwords if your browser is comprised. 

## Finally...

Hopefully this article has given you some easy-to-follow steps on password security. In addition to these tips, there are some other things to keep in mind. 

You should always be aware of emails and texts claiming to be from a service that asks you to enter your details—it could be a scam. 
If you want to check if something is ok, for example your Netflix account, simply log in directly to their website from your browser or app to check, to avoid bad actors getting your details. 

We all have a responsibility to keep our information secure. These tips will help you avoid most of the pitfalls you may encounter along the way but always be vigilant and take care of yourself while online.
