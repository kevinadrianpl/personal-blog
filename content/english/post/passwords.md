# The importance of secure passwords

Password security is an important subject to consider and provides the first line of defence against unauthorized access to your computer and personal information. 
A strong password will ensure that your device is more protected against bad actors and malicious applications. 

## So how do you choose a good password?

Picking a good password is easier than most people think. You need to think about 2 main things when choosing a password, firstly, is your password long enough and complex enough that it becomes harder to brute force crack it? Generally, you want to have 12 characters and above, I usually stick to 12 - 15 characters. Anything below 8 characters can be cracked in minutes. 

Secondly, can your password be dictionary cracked? Meaning that you want to choose a password that cannot be easily found in a word list or dictionary which is a list of the most commonly used words and passwords. For example, the password 'password123' would take seconds to crack, the password 'mywebsitepassword', even though this is a long password it can easily be found in a dictionary and takes seconds to crack as well. 

An example of a good password would be something like 'h0rs3st@ble!$'. This would take too long to crack for bad actors to even try, which is great. 
You should always maintain strong passwords for all your devices and accounts. Never re-use passwords because if one account were to get hacked, they would use that password on your other accounts and may get lucky. Re-using passwords is just as bad as a bad password. 

## Password Managers

You should consider using a password manager because that is one of the best defences against breaches. A password manager is the best choice if you have many different accounts. It helps you avoid re-using passwords.

There are many different managers such as 1Password, LastPass or Bitwarden that will help remember your passwords for you instead of remembering hundreds of different passwords. It will help you to remember all your passwords and another benefit password managers have is that they often tie into breach services such as [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) to notify you if your credentials have appeared in a known hack or breach in the past or future.

There are many amazing paid password managers but if you would prefer a free manager, I can recommend Bitwarden because their free tier is great considering the amount of features it has. 
The only drawback is that the client desktop version is very basic, but it still works perfectly fine.

You should always try to avoid reusing passwords which can be one of the easiest methods hackers have of gaining access to your other accounts, by obtaining one of your passwords using brute force attacks, they may use that password on other accounts to force their way in. 
It is getting easier to use this method with the cost of high-spec computing prices dropping more each year. 


## Here are a few guidelines for creating strong passwords to keep your information secure

-	Use a unique password for each of your important accounts (i.e., email and online banking). Do not use the same password across multiple accounts. 
-	Your password should be at least 12 characters long. Password should consist of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
-	Do not use personal information such as your name, age, date of birth, family members, pets, or any personal details such as favourite songs when constructing your password.
-	Avoid consecutive keyboard combinations (i.e., qwerty or asdfg).
-	Make sure no one  watches while you enter your password. If somebody is, ask them to look away or move away. Shoulder surfing is a common method of social engineering. 
-	Always log off/sign out if you leave your device for the day if not in your personal home – logging off will help ensure that no one uses your system for malicious purposes. 
-	Avoid entering your password on computers you don't control – they may have malicious applications installed to steal your password or have keyloggers installed on them.
-	Avoid entering passwords when connected to unsecured Wi-Fi connections (like at an airport or coffee shop) – hackers can intercept and capture your passwords and data over unsecured connections. Avoid connecting to public networks in general. 
-	Never tell your password to anyone. Even your IT department or family members.
-	Change your passwords regularly and avoid using the same password repeatedly.
-	Never write down your passwords on paper and hide underneath or near your workstation or telephone. This is usually the first-place bad actors look.
-	Always select “never” when your browser asks for your permission to remember your passwords. You risk losing all your passwords if your browser is comprised. 

## Finally...

Hopefully this article has given you some easy-to-follow steps on password security. In addition to these tips, there are some other things to keep in mind. 

You should always be aware of emails and texts claiming to be from a service that asks you to enter your details—it could be a scam. 
If you want to check if something is ok, for example your Netflix account, simply log in directly to their website from your browser or app to check, to avoid bad actors getting your details. 

We all have a responsibility to keep our information secure. These tips will help you avoid most of the pitfalls you may encounter along the way but always be vigilant and take care of yourself while online.
