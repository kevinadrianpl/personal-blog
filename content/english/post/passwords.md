Password security is an important subject to consider and the first line of defence against unauthorized access to your personal information. Strong passwords ensure that your device is protected against attackers and malicious applications. 

## So how do you choose a good password?

Picking a good password is easier than most people think. You need to think about 2 main factors when choosing a password, firstly, is your password long enough and complex enough that it becomes harder to brute force crack it? Generally, you want to have 12 characters and above, I usually stick to 12 - 15 characters. Anything below 8 characters can be cracked in a few minutes. 

Secondly, can your password be dictionary cracked? If your password is too short or contains dictionary words or can be found in word lists, then it can be cracked through brute force or guessed by someone. The best way to make a strong password is by making it long or consider using a 'passphrase' made up of many words. Using a password generator to create a long, random password can also be beneficial. Use https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/ to get an idea of how quickly common passwords can be cracked. 

An example of a good password would be something like 'h0rs3st@ble!$'. This would take too long to crack for attackers, which is great. 
You should always maintain strong passwords for all your devices and accounts. Always avoid re-using passwords which can be one of the easiest methods attackers have of gaining access to your other accounts. If one account were to get hacked, they would use that password on your other accounts and may get lucky. Re-using passwords is just as bad as a bad password. 

## Use a Secure Password Manager

You should consider using a password manager because that is one of the best defences against breaches. A password manager is the best choice if you have many different accounts on multiple platforms and devices. It helps you avoid re-using passwords.

There are many different managers such as 1Password, LastPass or Bitwarden. These managers help you to remember all your passwords by saving them and another benefit password managers have is that they often tie into breach services such as [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) to notify you if your credentials have appeared in known hacks or breaches in the past or alert you when a breach happens in the future.

There are many great paid password managers but if you would prefer a free manager, I can recommend Bitwarden because their free tier is great considering the amount of features it has. The only drawback is that the client desktop version is very basic, but it still works perfectly fine. 

For more advanced security, an encrypted offline password manager will give you full control over your data. KeePass is a popular choice that works on desktops as well as mobile. The only drawback with this is that it may be less convenient for some, and it will be up to you to back it up, and store it securely.

## Enable 2-Factor Authentication

2FA is when you must provide both something you know (a password or passphrase) and something you have (such as a code on your phone) to log in. This means that if anyone has your password through phishing, malware, or a data breach, they will have no way to able to log into your account. It's easy to get started, download an authenticator app onto your phone such as Google Authenticator and go to your account security settings and follow the steps to enable 2FA. Most applications and accounts have this feature. Next time you log in on a new device, you will be prompted for the code that displays in the app on your phone. This works without an internet connection and the code usually changes every 30-seconds.

Many password managers are able to generate 2FA codes for you to log into the account you're trying to access. It is not recommended to use your password manager as your 2FA authenticator as well, it could become a single point of failure if you are compromised. Instead, use a dedicated authenticator app such as Google Authenticator on your phone or laptop.

## Here are a few guidelines for creating strong passwords to keep your information secure

-	Use a unique password for each of your important accounts (i.e., email and online banking). Do not use the same password across multiple accounts. 
-	Your password should be at least 12 characters long. Password should consist of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
-	Do not use personal information such as your name, age, date of birth, family members, pets, or any personal details such as favourite songs when constructing your password.
-	Avoid consecutive keyboard combinations (i.e., qwerty or asdfg).
-	Make sure no one watches while you enter your password. If somebody is, ask them to look away or move away. Shoulder surfing is a common method of social engineering. 
-	Always log off/sign out if you leave your device for the day if not in your personal home – logging off will help ensure that no one uses your system for malicious purposes. 
-	Avoid entering your password on computers you don't control – they may have malicious applications installed to steal your password or have keyloggers installed on them.
-	Avoid entering passwords when connected to unsecured Wi-Fi connections (like at an airport or coffee shop) – hackers can intercept and capture your passwords and data over unsecured connections. Avoid connecting to public networks in general. 
-	Never tell your password to anyone. Even your IT department or family members.
-	Change your passwords regularly and avoid using the same password repeatedly.
-	Never write down your passwords on paper and hide underneath or near your workstation or telephone. This is usually the first-place bad actors look.
-	Always select “never” when your browser asks for your permission to remember your passwords. You risk losing all your passwords if your browser is comprised. 

## Finally...

Hopefully this article has given you some easy-to-follow steps on password security. In addition to these tips, there are some other things to keep in mind. 

You should always be aware of emails and texts claiming to be from a service that asks you to enter your details—it could be a scam. 
If you want to check if something is ok, for example your Netflix account, simply log in directly to their website from your browser or app to check, to avoid bad actors getting your details. 

We all have a responsibility to keep our information secure. These tips will help you avoid most of the pitfalls you may encounter along the way but always be vigilant and take care of yourself while online.
