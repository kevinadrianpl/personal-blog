Everyone would like to believe that they would never be fooled by such an attack these days, but phishing remains as popular as ever. Internet users may have become more aware, but attackers have also become more skilled in how to lure in more victims. 
Below I’ll explain more on how these phishing attempts are more sophisticated, and how you or your company can outsmart them.

## How to prevent phishing attacks

The term “phishing” goes all the way back to the late 90s when it was used to by groups that were imitating AOL using AOL messenger, asking people to verify their accounts and billing information. Many users fell for this scam due to the simplicity of the attack. 

## Advanced phishing strategies

The core principles of phishing have remained the same, but the motivation is getting malware into your network or accessing credentials. This is still accomplished through malicious links or attachments via email, text messages, web pages and social media.

What is different now is the presentation. There are still emails with obviously fake email addresses with tons of spelling errors and an increasing number of them are nearly impossible to tell from the real thing. This leads to websites prompting credentials that look almost identical to the site they are imitating. 
Threat actors are now making conversation-hijacking attacks, which uses previously compromised email accounts to reply to ongoing email threads. They get in with an email that has malicious links or attachments during a conversation, easily catching other members of the thread off guard because they already trust that email account. 

## How do phishing emails get to your inbox?
The backend of phishing has also evolved as there have been increasing attempts in evading filters. One method is using images of text to avoid being readable and tagged as junk mail. 
Another is obfuscating URLs by simply adding additional characters, spoofing URLs and email addresses, fooling both the filter and recipient into opening an email or continuing as normal when on a fake website. Attackers have become shrewder in constantly trying new tactics, knowing that as soon as one obfuscation or evasion technique is exposed, they’ll need to pivot on to another.

## Who does the phishing and who are the victims?

Another recent change is in who is targeted. There are massive campaigns aimed at whoever will click a link, but certain phishing attacks are far more precise. Spear-phishing, for instance, targets specific users or companies using sites they are familiar with or imitating known users to lure them in. Whaling is even more precise, aimed at high level executives and key users. 
Extensive research is usually conducted so threat actors know what may entice these companies or individual users to open a message. From there, an email is designed to personalize the content and convey the right tone for the business or individual. 
A whaling attack against a C-level user or employee may require a certain level of urgency to ensure that it’s opened, typically involving financial, legal, or, ironically, security matters.
There is an increasing number of attackers who phish nowadays. Before, threat actors were only those who understood the mechanics of phishing. Now, phishing kits can be bought easily on the dark web, giving anyone who has a reason to phish the tools needed to do so. This has boosted the number of attacks even farther. 
With constant attacks being launched, it’s no wonder that so many people have been fooled.

## How can you avoid getting phished?

Recent changes in the security world are being made to help strengthen filters and prevent phish from getting to your inbox, and browser security is also evolving to detect malicious websites the moment you land on them. 
In future, phishing will continue to be an ongoing challenge for businesses and users. We should all learn to strategically manage this threat by following these steps:

### Organise anti-phishing penetration tests in your company.

You shouldn’t wait until after you’ve been hit to find out that your users are susceptible to phishing. Social engineering tests imitates phishing campaigns to safely determine whether your users are vulnerable to, and what types of phishing is most likely to fool them. 
Using social engineering pen testing services and tools allows you to find out where your weaknesses are by launching an attack just like those currently being used by actual threat actors in a safe environment. These campaigns can be the difference between a company that suffers a huge breach, and one that remains secure.

### Educate users and follow best practices.

No matter the outcome of your pen test, it is always worthwhile to educate your users. Teach them ways to identify phishing attempts such as odd URLs and opening links or attachments, particularly those that come unprompted or from unusual sources. 
Follow best practices, like going directly to a website instead of using a link when possible. You should keep an eye on [OpenPhish](https://openphish.com/) and [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/) to familiarize yourself with the most common phishing currently floating around.

### Test on a regular basis.

Anti-phishing penetration tests should be done frequently. 
The best way to ensure your education efforts are effective is to test again. New phishing methods are constantly being introduced, so you’ll want to stay up to date on the latest tactics. Frequent testing keeps employees accountable, vigilant, and ensures that new users aren’t a security risk that goes unaddressed for too long.
