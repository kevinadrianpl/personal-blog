Phishing email attacks have evolved over the years to become more intricate, enticing, and tougher to spot. 
Flagging suspicious messages in your inbox can be tough so you need to get familiar with the different forms a phishing email can take on. Below is a list of the different types of phishing:

### Phishing Email
Phishing emails still cause a large amount of the data breaches in the world. They are designed to appear to come from a legitimate source, like your bank, PayPal, etc. Cybercriminals hide their presence in details like the URL, an email attachment, and more.

### Spear Phishing
This is a targeted phishing attack that relies on data that a cybercriminal has already collected about the victim. Spear phishing usually uses urgent and familiar language to encourage the victim to act immediately.

### Link Manipulation
This relies on carefully worded phishing emails, this type of attack includes a link to popular sites to make you trust it. This link takes victims to a spoofed version of the popular website, designed to look like the real site, and asks you to confirm or update your account credentials.

### Fake Websites
Attackers send phishing emails that include links to fake websites asking the victim to enter their credentials or other information. The website will often make subtle change to a known URL to trick users, such as mail.update.google.com instead of mail.google.com.

### CEO Fraud
This attack uses an email address that is familiar to the victim, like one belonging to a CEO, HR Manager, or IT support. The email urgently asks the victim to act and transfer funds, update employee details, or install a new app on their computer.

### Content Injection
Attackers hack a familiar website and include a fake website login page or pop-up that directs visitors to a fake website.

### Session Hijacking
This is an advanced phishing attack, attackers gain access to a company web server and steal confidential information stored on the server.

### Malware
Attackers install malicious software on a computer or company network after someone clicks a link in an email attachment. These attachments look valid or may even be disguised as funny videos, PDFs, or GIFs.

### 'Evil Twin' Wi-Fi
This happens when free Wi-Fi access points are spoofed. Victims unknowingly log into the Wi-Fi hotspot. Wi-Fi access points that are commonly spoofed include coffee shops, airports, hospitals, shopping malls, public parks, and other public locations.

### Mobile Phishing (Smishing)
A fake SMS, social media message, voice mail, or other in-app message asks the user to update their account details, change their password, or tells them their account has been compromised. The message usually includes a link that steals the victim’s personal information or installs malware on the mobile device.

### Voice Phishing (Vishing)
This happens when a caller leaves a strongly worded voicemail or voicenote that urges the user to respond immediately and to call another phone number. These voicemails are urgent and convince the victim for example, that their bank account will be suspended if they don’t call back.

### Man-In-The-Middle
This attack tricks two people into believing that they’re emailing each other but the phisher is sending fake emails to each person asking them to share or to update confidential information.

### Malvertising
This technique uses online advertisements or pop-ups to get people to click a valid-looking link that installs malware on their computer.

Like most phishing attacks, social engineering preys on the natural human tendency to trust people and companies. This leads to users failing to carefully review email details and automatically trusting the sender’s request.
